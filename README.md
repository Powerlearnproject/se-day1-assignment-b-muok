Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing; and maintaining software.
Importance:
1. Reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias.
2. Efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining quality standards.
3. Scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
4. Security - implement protection practices like authentication, authorization; and encryption to secure user information. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Development of programming languages.
-Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
-Advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
-Adoption of agile methodologies in the 2000s.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements - it involves understanding the user needs and system requirements. This is determined by data collection through methods such as interviews and attending workshops. The data is then analyzed; strengths and weaknesses are identified. These assist in coming up with the goals of the product.
2. Design - it involves coming up with detailed designs of the software outlook, user interface; and how the aspects will fit together.
3. Implementation - it involves writing code and building the software as per the design specifications.
4. Testing - involves conducting structured tests to ensure bugs are fixed and the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment - it is releasing the software to users. This can be through enabling access online on a website or a download link.
6. Maintenance - it involves providing continuous support, updates; and enhancements to the software after deployment.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Waterfall methodology – It is linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. It is ideal where project requirements are well-defined, stable; and unlikely to change. For example, when a company is building a system for its internal use with well-known requirements. 
-There is Low flexibility, changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete. 
-Customer feedback comes late after the product is developed. 
-Testing is done at the end of the development process.
2. Agile methodology –It is iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). It is ideal where a project requires flexibility, rapid adaptation to changing requirements, continuous feedback; and collaboration. For example, a consumer electronic company that wants to build a prototype software to gather user feedback before building the final product.
- It is highly flexible, adapts to changing requirements, 
-Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint.
-Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software developer- responsible for developing applications, programs; and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional.
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practices when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirements.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirements before deployment.
- analyses the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient.
- develop and execute automation scripts using open-source tools.
3. Project Manager - assembles and leads the software development team.
 - discuss the project and its requirements with the client and software developers.
 - creates the roadmap for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) - these are software suites that provide special tools for programmers to write code, debug code, compile code; and assist in testing code. Examples: Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, Sublime Text
Version Control Systems (VCS) – are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Examples: Git, Subversion, 
Importance:
-Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
-Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification.
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
-Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -
2. Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
Solution: adopting agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints
3. Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures.
Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
4. Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes.
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
5. Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task.
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
6. Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users.
Solution: Use scalable architecture, and emphasize reliability.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit tests – focuses on testing individual source codes, and isolated components of a software application; such as a single function or class, components used by the software They ensure that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 2. Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together. They help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
3. System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions. It helps to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security.
4. Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. These test justifies whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is the art of feeding an AI model with questions or statements with a view of getting the best response.  
It is vital as it ensures results that are received are clear and accurate.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt - What is the population of Kenya?                                                                                             
Improved prompt - What is the population of women over 20 years old in Kenya?

The improved prompt is brief and clear; it is not ambiguous and specifies the details. This enhances accuracy and more details in the output.
